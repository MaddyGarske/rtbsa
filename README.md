# Real-Time BSA
Real-Time BSA (aka RTBSA) is a PyQt application to view pulse-by-pulse (BSA)
data from LCLS.  The typical use is to look at the pulse-by-pulse correlation
between two BSA signals, although the application can also plot a single signal
vs. time.  A polynomial fit can be applied to the curves, making it easy to
optimize the correlation between signals.
